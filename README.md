# Brazilian National Football Competition Scraper & Email Service

This project provides a scraper for fetching match data from Brazilian national football competitions (SÃ©rie A) and sends the data in an Excel format via email. It is built using **FastAPI** for the backend and uses **scraping** techniques to collect competition data from a website. 

This project was developed as part of the evaluation requirement for the **"Project and System Analysis"** course.

## Features

- **Scraping match data**: The scraper fetches match details like date, time, teams (host and visitor), score, round, competition name, and season.
- **Excel export**: The collected data is saved as an Excel file (.xlsx) for easy use and distribution.
- **Email service**: The project includes an email service that sends the Excel file as an attachment to a specified email address.
- **Asynchronous architecture**: The project uses FastAPI's async features for non-blocking, high-performance scraping and email sending.

## Main Libraries

- **FastAPI**: The backend framework used to build the API. It is asynchronous and fast, allowing for scalable performance.
- **BeautifulSoup**: A Python library used for parsing HTML and extracting data from web pages.
- **Requests**: A simple HTTP library used for making requests to the scraping targets.
- **Pandas**: Used to structure and manipulate the scraped data before exporting it as an Excel file.
- **OpenPyXL**: Required for exporting data to Excel format.
- **aiosmtplib**: An asynchronous SMTP client for sending emails without blocking the event loop.
- **Regex (re)**: Used for extracting dates, times, and other relevant data from the HTML content.
